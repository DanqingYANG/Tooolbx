The **combineFolderNameWithFileName** is designed to deal with the following folder structure.

In each folder we have some files with no index. Sometimes it can be hundred of this kind of folders and we need to flatten the folder structure, get all files in root path and add index before each file. Thus a **combineFolderNameWithFileName** is designed.
